# PMAT-Course_Final
Hello Everyone,

Welcome to my GitHub repository for my final project on Malware Analysis and Triage. For this project, I have selected a malware sample and conducted a detailed analysis across various stages, including static and dynamic analysis. I have documented the findings, techniques used, and conclusions in a comprehensive report, which is attached to this repository for review. The report provides insights into the malware's behavior, capabilities, and potential mitigations.

Thanks & Regards,

Niyanth
